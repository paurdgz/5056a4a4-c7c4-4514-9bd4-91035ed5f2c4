-- A) Get the average happiness_score of the countries labeled with a GDP
-- of "billion" and "trillion".

-- the G7 countries (i.e., `Canada`, `France`, `Germany`, `Italy`, `Japan`, `United Kingdom`, `United States`)
-- order by happiness_score (DESC).


-- C) Create a custom score called "score" using this formula: happiness_score * density
-- Where `density` is population / area_km2. Show the top 10 countries (name) with greater score.


-- WINE ANALYSIS

-- D) Get the number of wines per variety, ordered by the latter (desc)


-- E) How many wines are registered per country? Show country name and number of wines, ordered by the latter (desc).
